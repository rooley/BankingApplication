Banking Application for Indiana Interactive

This app was designed based on the following requirements document:

Description
One of our partners has requested that we model a simple banking application. No user interface is
necessary for this application however unit tests are required to verify that all requirements for the
application have been met.
Requirements
 A bank that has a name as well as a list of accounts
 The following types of accounts: Checking, Corporate Investment, Individual Investment
 All accounts must have an owner
 All accounts must support deposits, withdrawals, and transfers to any other type of account
 Individual Investment accounts can withdraw up to $1,000 at a time
 It is not permissible to overdraft an account
Deliverable
Model the system in the language of your choice. In the absence of a working user or web service
interface the unit tests verify that the system behaves as expected.

I chose to write this application in C# as it is the language I have the most experience with. It also seemed to be one of the easier options for unit testing, 
which I had no prior experience with. I'm sure there are a million ways to improve upon my work here, but I hope it shows I'm willing to put in the time and effort
to learn new things and write some quality code. Thank you to the Indiana Interactive team for giving me another chance at this opportunity.
